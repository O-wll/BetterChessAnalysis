This is a chess based application that enhances the game analysis experience. It allows users to save notes on each move of their game. Players can also save branches to see how a game could've gone down if they played a different move. 

Later on, a chess engine will be implement to evaluate moves, such as Brilliant or Blunder, and evaluate positions by giving a numerical value, like +1.4 (White is better).
