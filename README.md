Better Chess Analysis by Dat Nguyen

Project Started: 12/27/2024

This project aims to provide chess players a better experience analyzing their chess games after a match.
It's an application that will allow you to analyze your chess games by going through the different moves made throughout the match, the same way existing websites like chess.com or lichess does.
The issue with those websites, however, is that chess analysis can feel unintuitive, as they do not provide with much during analysis besides engine evaluation. You may come up with a good reason on why a move is good but you won't have anyway to write that down for future reference.  

The goal of this project is to provide a more productive way to analyze chess games and solve the issues of traditional chess analysis. The features that will be added to this app are explained below, these features will benefit the player during game analysis. Any player of any skill level will be able to use this application for their own purposes.

Features:
- Interactable Chessboard with the pieces, allowing players to make moves as you would on chess.com/lichess.
- Import Games to interact and take notes with
- The ability to make and save notes after each move. This allows the player to make notes on why they made that move, what their ideas were, and overall any comments about the move they made.
- Save Analysis. After going through the match and taking notes, drawing arrows, making branches, or highlighting, players can save their analysis in the application for later reference and start a new application.

How it works:
1. When the application starts, players will be asked if they want to import their game, they do not have to.
2. Players will go through their moves they and their opponent played. Here, they can make notes to analyze their games to see how they could've improved and to see what they missed.
3. When players are done analyzing, they can save their analysis with their notes in the app by quitting. 

This project will be developed using Python 3.10
Changes and updates will be made on this project and this document will update to reflect those changes and features.
